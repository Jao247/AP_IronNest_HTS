#def set_all_rules(world: IronNestWorld) -> None:
    # In order for AP to generate an item layout that is actually possible for the player to complete,
    # we need to define rules for our Entrances and Locations.
    # Note: Regions do not have rules, the Entrances connecting them do!
    # We'll do entrances first, then locations, and then finally we set our victory condition.

    #set_all_entrance_rules(world)
    #set_all_location_rules(world)
    #set_completion_condition(world)


#def set_all_entrance_rules(world: IronNestWorld) -> None:
    # First, we need to actually grab our entrances. Luckily, there is a helper method for this.

    # Now, let's make some rules!
    # First, let's handle the transition from the overworld to the bottom right room,
    # which requires slashing a bush with the Sword.
    # For this, we need a rule that says "player has a Sword".
    # We can use a "Has"-type rule from the rule_builder module for this.


#def set_all_location_rules(world: IronNestWorld) -> None:
    # Location rules work no differently from Entrance rules.
    # Most of our locations are chests that can simply be opened by walking up to them.
    # Thus, their logical requirements are covered by the Entrance rules of the Entrances that were required to
    # reach the region that the chest sits in.
    # However, our two enemies work differently.
    # Entering the room with the enemy is not enough, you also need to have enough combat items to be able to defeat it.
    # So, we need to set requirements on the Locations themselves.
    # Since combat is a bit more complicated, we'll use this chance to cover some advanced access rule concepts.

    # In "set_all_entrance_rules", we had a rule for a location that doesn't always exist.
    # In this case, we had to check for its existence (by checking the player's chosen options) before setting the rule.
    # Other times, you may have a situation where a location can have two different rules depending on the options.
    # In our case, the enemy in the right room has more health if hard mode is selected,
    # so ontop of the Sword, the player will either need one more health or a Shield in hard mode.
    # First, let's make our sword condition.


#def set_completion_condition(world: IronNestWorld) -> None:
    # Finally, we need to set a completion condition for our world, defining what the player needs to win the game.
    # For this, we can use world.set_completion_rule.
    # You can just set a completion condition directly like any other condition, referencing items the player receives:
    #world.set_completion_rule(HasAll("Sword", "Shield"))

    # In our case, we went for the Victory event design pattern (see create_events() in locations.py).
    # So lets undo what we just did, and instead set the completion condition to:
    #world.set_completion_rule(Has("Victory"))


# One final comment about rules:
# If your world exclusively uses Rule Builder rules (like APQuest), it's worth trying CachedRuleBuilderWorld.
# CachedRuleBuilderWorld is a subclass of World that has a bunch of caching magic to make rules faster.
# Just have your world class subclass CachedRuleBuilderWorld instead of World:
#   class APQuestWorld(CachedRuleBuilderWorld): ...
# This may speed up your world, or it may make it slower.
# The exact factors are complex and not well understood, but there is no harm in trying it.
# Generate a few seeds and see if there is a noticeable difference!
# If you're wondering, author has checked: APQuest is too simple to see any benefits, so we'll stick with "World".
